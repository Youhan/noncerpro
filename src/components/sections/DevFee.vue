        <p>This miner has a fixed 2% dev fee. That means 2 minutes(plus 20 seconds to compensate for reconnecting and possible invalid shares at the begining) in every 100 minutes, miner will run with the donation wallet address.</p>
        <p>Dev fee was 1% in AMD miner V1.0.1 and prior versions.</p>
